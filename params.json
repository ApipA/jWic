{"name":"jWic","tagline":"The Java Web Interface Framework","body":"jWic is a java-based development framework for developing dynamic web applications with the convenience and familiarity of 'rich client' style programming.\r\n\r\nThe project is currently undergoing a massive refactoring. We plan to have a first stable version by mid May'13 (v5.0). The highlights of this version compared to the previous v4.x version are:\r\n\r\n* Migrated the JavaScript backend library from prototype.js to jQuery (1.9)\r\n* Implemented proper support to 'theme' your application, based on the jQuery UI themes\r\n* Various standard controls are now represented by jQuery UI elements, such as Button, TabStrip, ProgressBar, ToolTip, Window, ...\r\n* Merged the separate control library ecolib into the jWic project itself, including the javascript libraries, css files, etc.\r\n* Removed a set of older controls where an equivalent replacement was available\r\n* Distribution is now split into jwic-core, jwic-controls, jwic-compatibility and jwic-samples, but build from a single project\r\n* Lot's of clean up in the JavaScript and CSS pieces","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
