Quick Installation Guide
========================

1. Setup a blank web project in your favorit IDE (i.e. Dynamic Web Project, Tomcat Project, ...)

2. Copy the content of the default webapp folder (webapps/default) into the webfolder of your project

3. Copy the required libraries from the lib folder to the lib folder of your webapp 
   ({webRoot}/WEB-INF/lib. The minimum required libraries are:
     - commons-collections-2.1.jar
     - commons-lang-2.1.jar
     - commons-logging.jar
     - dom4j.jar
     - log4j-1.2.8.jar
     - velocity-1.4.jar
     
4. Copy the jWic libraries (jwic.jar and jwic-samples.jar) into the same lib folder of your webapp.

Now you can start the server/webapp and run one of the samples.

If you are going to update from an older version, always have a look at the migration guide that
contains valuable informations. You find the guide here:
