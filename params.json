{"name":"jWic","tagline":"The Java Web Interface Framework","body":"jWic is a java-based development framework for developing dynamic web applications with the convenience and familiarity of 'rich client' style programming.\r\n\r\nToday, there are two basic concepts on web application development. One popular way is to build the application so that the majority of the code runs in the browser as JavaScript, with a smaller back-end on the server providing API's for handling data. AngularJS or GWT are one of the most popular frameworks for this use-case. On the other side, there are frameworks where the application code is run on the server side with a traditional request-response cycle where the entire page is submitted/refreshed. Since AJAX became popular, many of those frameworks found ways to support AJAX as well (i.e. JSF), they yet have roots in the classic request/response pattern.\r\n\r\njWic is going a middle way, in which the application is written in Java and executed on the server side, it is truly component oriented and fully leverages AJAX to dynamically update pages in a seamless fashion. Controls can be designed using HTML and JavaScript, but the application logic resides on the server. We found, that this is a very beneficial model for enterprise applications, that grow large and use resources from the server.\r\n\r\nCheck out the wiki pages, to learn more about jWic.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
