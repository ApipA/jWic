Using jWic with Spring
======================

This directory contains configuration files that demonstrate how jWic is used
with the springframework. Additional to the configuration files in the WEB-INF 
directory, you need:

	- The jwic directory from the default webapp including all subdirs.
	- The sample directory from the default webapp. The *.xwic files are not used and 
	  could be deleted, but they do no harm either.
	- The WEB-INF/jwic directory from the default webapp including all subdirs.
