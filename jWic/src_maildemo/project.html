<p>This demonstration implements a client application for a personal mailbox. It
is using a classic MVC architecture to connect the different controls (views) with
the data (model).</p>
<p>In this application, you can see the usage of the TableViewer control, which is used 
to list the mails in the selected folders. After selecting a mail in the list, a preview
of the mail is displayed in the lower preview panel.</p>
<p>When you are inspect the source code, you may start with the <code><sv:link name="MailDemoApp.java">MailDemoApp</sv:link></b></code> class
in <code><sv:link>de.jwic.maildemo.main</sv:link></code> package.</p>
