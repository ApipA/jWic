jWic

jWic is a java-based development framework for developing dynamic web applications with the convenience and familiarity of 'rich client' style programming.

In 2013, the project did undergo a massive refactoring, switching from prototypejs to jQuery, including the use of jQuery UI 
controls as UI components.
